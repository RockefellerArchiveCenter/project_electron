# User Stories

We created [user stories](/user-stories) to help define project requirements as part of the discovery process for Project Electron. They were gathered through in-person interviews, surveys and existing literature.

The initial set of user stories are divided into four groups:

*   [Donors and Depositors](donors-and-depositors.csv)
*   [Researchers](researchers.csv)
*   [Rockefeller Archive Center staff](rac-staff.csv)
*   [Allied Information Professionals](allied-information-professionals.csv)

An additional set of user stories was generated around archival discovery and delivery in 2019:

*   [Discovery and Delivery](discovery-and-delivery.csv)

### Personas

Based on the user stories, we developed thirteen [user personas](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/personas/tree/base/project-electron-personas) and a persona template. These personas help synthesize our user research, and we engage them in design and development processes as a strategy to center the people who will be using the systems.
