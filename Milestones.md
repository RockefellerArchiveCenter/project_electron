## Discovery

September 2016-December 2016

### **Web presence**

Create a website to serve as a central clearinghouse for project updates, documentation contact information and other materials.

### **Communication plan**

Identify key stakeholders - both internal and external - and develop a plan for communicating project status to them, including formal and informal reporting, presentations, and social media strategy.

### **Gather user stories from donor organizations, RAC staff, allied professionals and researchers**

Identify stakeholder donor organizations with a range of technical infrastructure and support, develop conversation guidelines and interview to determine user stories for ingest and access of digital records.

### **Review and reorganize existing user stories**

Review user stories created for DAMS project and determine which are in scope and which are out of scope, then organize according to archival functions.

### **Develop personas**

Develop user personas to help guide design and development decisions for all aspects of Project Electron.

### **Determine documentation strategy**

Determine appropriate means of placing documentation under version control and making it as widely available as possible with clear licensing. Solution will likely require multiple licensing and permissions options. Use MIT license as default.

### **Archivematica integration strategy**

Develop overall strategy for using Archivematica in ingest processes.

## Repository implementation

Starting January 2017

### **Develop repository requirements**

Based on user stories and personas, develop requirements for repository

### **Determine Minimum Viable Product and subsequent development for repository**

Determine a baseline for repository product by end of year one and identify further development priorities.

### **Scan and test install repository solutions**

Look for and set up test installs of potential repository solutions and develop a report with pros and cons.

### **Select repository solution**

Using the potential solutions report, requirements and personas, select a repository solution.

### **Repository installation**

Install selected repository solution.

### **Repository customization**

Customize repository based on functional requirements so it meets minimum viable product baseline.

### **Data modeling**

Model archival description in RDF to support functional requirements and use cases, using Portland Common Data Model and other community-driven projects as a basis.

### **Service Level Agreement**

Create a service level agreement to govern maintenance of repository.
