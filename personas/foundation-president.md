![persona image](img/paul-roberts.jpg)

## Background

Paul is 62 years old, with a law degree from Georgetown University. He’s originally from Los Angeles, but moved to Chicago for work. He is affluent, and lives outside of the city with his wife and family. He is the head of an operating foundation. He enjoys going to the symphony, museums, and other social gatherings. Both of his children have moved out to attend university.

## Goals and Motivations

His primary goal is to provide strategic vision for his organization and to grow its brand through networking and other partnerships. Paul wants to provide access to his company’s historic records in order to build their public image. However, he’s extremely worried about the confidentiality of the content they make available. He wants to make sure to follow protocol, while meeting the needs of his board and raising the organization’s profile. This is likely his final job before retirement and he wants to strengthen his legacy. He wants to make records available for publication to promote research and use, which in turn promotes institutional prestige. He also wants his employees to work as efficiently as possible.

## Needs

Paul needs to meet the demands of his board using high level statistics and operating information. He also has a duty to uphold his organization’s mission and make sure that everyone is honoring its values. Given the changing landscape of organizational records, he needs technological support to help him understand what he should be doing with email and other digital records. He needs organizational buy-in and support for meeting the mission statement and reporting back to his board. He needs clear workflows and automation to increase efficiency. He also needs the archive to create a better way to transfer materials and make them widely available. Paul needs the archive to integrate more substantially with third parties like IssueLab to help him promote his organization to a wider audience.

## Pain Points

Paul’s organization has, in the past, lacked a clear records policy, and it’s difficult to monitor every document that leaves it. Sometimes his staff, many of whom are resistant to change, get too bogged down in the details and in turn hinder adoption of new policies. He has often found it difficult to get copies of documents back from the archive due to slow turnaround, difficult channels of communication, or lack of clarity around how to find material. His board and legal department are extremely concerned about potential lawsuits and bad press, so he has to be extremely careful about the content that the archive makes widely available.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use

Paul has a secretary, but is comfortable with personal computers and Microsoft Office. He communicates often through email. He just recently switched from a Blackberry to an iPhone, and is constantly checking his email.
