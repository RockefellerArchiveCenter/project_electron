## Background
This section should contain demographic information about the persona. It should provide a snapshot of who the person is: age, geographic location, household situation, etc.  

## Goals and Motivations   
Include what drives this persona's behavior. Why do they act the way they do? 
The goals and motivations should point to specific usage patterns and provide reasons why those patterns exist. 
This section should provide us with enough information to understand why the persona needs what it does, and why certain things become pain points. 
Goals generally include experience goals, life goals, or end goals.

## Needs
Information about what the persona requires in order to help meet their goals.

## Pain Points
Areas where the persona could run into issues in completing their goals.
These issues will not derail a goal, like lack of a need, but will cause stress or difficulty.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use 
This is the persona's technology profile. What devices, apps, and level of computer skill do they have?
How does the persona use these tools in fulfillment of their goals?
