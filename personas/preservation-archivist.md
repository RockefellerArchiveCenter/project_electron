_Museum Preservation Archivist_

![persona image](img/elena-gutierrez.jpg)

## Background

Elena works as a preservation archivist at a large museum in New York City. Her job is temporary and partially grant-funded. She lives in Brooklyn and commutes to work via bicycle when the weather permits. Her social circle is large and diverse. In her spare time, she volunteers at a local community center teaching technology skills to elementary and middle school kids. Her graduate degree, which she recently received, focused heavily on digital preservation techniques and activities, although she is also conversant in paper-based conservation methods. She is very involved in professional organizations and activities at the regional and national levels.

## Goals and Motivations

Elena would really like to find a full-time permanent job. She sees her current job as an opportunity for her to gain skills and increase her professional profile and network. As a result, she does a lot of work that falls outside of her official job description, working collaboratively across departments. She has a reputation of being a good teacher and team player. Driven by her knowledge of archival principles and practices, Elena is committed to open access for archival records as well as open source tools and methodologies. She wants to make her workflows as efficient as possible so that she can make the best use of her time.

## Needs

Elena needs to automate as many processes as possible because she is way overcommitted and cannot possibly accomplish everything on her plate otherwise. She wants a comprehensive framework with which she can queue and trigger many of the digital preservation processes she needs to perform, such as file format identification and fixity checking. She also needs extensible preservation-level storage for digital records. Elena is also constantly looking for a community that can help support her work through technical expertise, policy development, or both.

## Pain Points

Elena’s temporary job status means that she is constantly worried about her job security and is always on the lookout for a better opportunity.  She is frustrated by inefficient legacy processes which are often poorly documented (if they are documented at all) and by legacy data which is often messy and inaccurate. She doesn’t understand why she is the only person in the organization who has broad technical knowledge and wishes that some of her colleagues would pick up technical skills.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use

Elena is an expert user of technology. She is comfortable in Windows, Mac and a variety of Linux environments and is fluent in using the command line. At work she has a powerful Windows machine, but she often has to set up a virtual Linux environment in order to use digital preservation tools. She thinks creatively about technology and is always looking for ways to integrate tools into her life.
