## Background

Nina is a 33 year old woman living in Los Angeles, CA. She got her start as a production assistant and has slowly worked her way up to directing documentary films. She’s coming off her first documentary, which had modest success. Nina has already started working on her second feature, which has her traveling around a lot. She’s betting most of her savings and industry capital on this film, so it has become her life for the next few years. She’s deeply involved in her community and describes herself as a social activist.

## Goals and Motivations

Nina hopes to change the world with her documentaries. She believes that her films will enact social change and will better the world through history and telling of stories. As such, she’s extremely passionate about her work. However, she also has a budget which she cannot exceed and a deadline by which she needs to get her film into post-production or risk missing her release window. She often only needs a single document or photograph, and she needs it as soon as possible. She’s looking for that “a-ha” moment of discovery that can give her film extra impact.

## Needs

Nina needs requested materials and information as fast as possible and would love to be able to see the material online before requesting copies for production. She’s looking for quick reference responses from the archive with confirmation that the materials and information are what she needs. She’s not interested in archival context or jargon because the document is a means to an end for her.

## Pain Points

She finds the traditional archival research process tedious and time-consuming. There’s too much archival jargon, access and use statements are not clear, and the material isn’t accessible online. Nina can’t travel on her limited budget, and would love to see materials before having to pay for high quality representations of them. She also needs materials as soon as possible, and doesn’t like the long wait times for archival duplication. Sometimes she has trouble finding what she needs because the description is either too minimal or inaccurate.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use

She’s very comfortable with technology and has spent a lot of time working in editing software. She almost exclusively uses Macs for her work, but she’s very familiar with Photoshop and other creative editing tools. She’s almost never found without her Macbook. She doesn’t work with the command line much, but she’s not scared of it.
