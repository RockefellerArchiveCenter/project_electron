## Background

Jose is a 37 year old from New York City, NY. He got his Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Jose briefly worked for a startup in the Bay Area, but wasn’t a fan of the tech culture in California. He’s committed to keeping on top of tech trends, and reads a lot of blogs and is active on Twitter. Jose is married with two children, and likes to build his own computers. He likes hardware, but has more experience working with software and virtual machines. He currently works at a smaller foundation as the only full-time IT professional, where he supports a system to transfer digital records from his institution to the archive.

## Goals and Motivations

As the only IT professional in his organization, he doesn’t have much time on his hands. As such, he wants efficiency and automation in as many workflows as possible, specifically for material transfer. In order to lighten his load, he wants to use cloud infrastructure and services to reduce the burden on him to maintain and support on-premise infrastructure. He wants to empower users to work with technology, and he wants to make working with computers as easy as possible for his organization so he can spend less time answering emails about how to do something on the computer. He knows that his organization uses many different types of storage and wants to consolidate workflows to handle data and asset retrieval. He is concerned with maintaining the security of his organization’s systems.

## Needs

Jose needs the archive’s digital repository to meet the tech capabilities and needs of his organization. He needs to make sure transfers from his organization to the archive are secure. He also needs to be able to speak to someone technologically versed at the archive in order to have a voice in technological decisions.

## Pain Points

His organization often doesn’t understand the work that he does, and Jose feels like he is constantly trying, with only limited success, to get staff interested in learning more about the systems and tools they use. He often needs to work with proprietary software which is generally more locked down than he wants. Migration to different systems has been difficult. In the past, differences in work culture and siloing of technical expertise have acted as a barrier to cooperation between Jose’s department and others at the organization. Additionally, sometimes the archive overestimates the technological abilities of his organization’s staff.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use

Jose is very comfortable with technology. He uses personal computers at home, and Macs at work, and owns a smartphone and a tablet. He looks for ways to automate day-to-day responsibilities and is comfortable working with MySQL, virtual machines, Linux, and more. He has some experience setting up servers, backing them up, and recovering data. He handles all the day-to-day tech needs of his organization as well, including exploring and installing any software that aids in its work.
