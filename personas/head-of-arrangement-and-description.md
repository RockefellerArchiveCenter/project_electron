_Head of Arrangement and Description_

![persona image](img/matthew-harris.jpg)

## Background

Matthew manages arrangement and description processes at a small independent archive in Chicago, where he has worked for 12 years. He is 55, and has been happily married for 27 years. His two children are both in college. Matthew lives in Naperville and commutes to work by car. He supervises two other processing archivists, as well as a number of part-time interns and volunteers. He is part of a local all-male acapella group that performs nationally and has won several awards.

## Goals and Motivations

Matthew is primarily concerned with providing access to his institution’s holdings. He recognizes that researchers and archivists have different information needs. He wants to support all of them to the best of his ability, but he privileges the needs of researchers. To that end, he wants to make arrangement and description processes efficient so that his department can process incoming material as quickly as possible. He believes that his staff should be accountable for meeting processing metrics. Although he is a proponent of minimal processing practices, he also wants to mitigate liability for his institution, so he is concerned about unintentionally making personally identifiable information public. He doesn’t have a large budget to spend on technology and needs to stretch every dollar as far as he can.

## Needs

In general, Matthew needs tools that allow him to maximize his team’s efficiency. This includes tools for transforming unstructured data into structured data, enriching and enhancing metadata with external vocabularies for names and subjects, and batch editing tools for specific data fields. He also needs to track multiple processes so that he can make sure things are happening on schedule, and he wants to maintain an audit trail of arrangement and description actions so that if something goes wrong he can trace it back to the source. Many of the collections held by his institution have significant access restrictions, including embargoes, and he wants to make sure that agreements signed with donors are honored.

## Pain Points

Matthew is not a fan of tedious and error-prone processes, and he feels that there are far too many of them in place at his institution. He also spends a lot of time training and supervising temporary interns and volunteers, only to see them move on.

## Current Devices, Apps & IT Use

Matthew understands technology at a high level but doesn’t have a lot of hands-on experience with many of these tools or systems. He is very supportive of his staff learning new technologies. He doesn’t have a large professional development budget with which to support these activities, so he encourages his employees to learn by experimenting. He is a heavy email user and frequently uses other basic office applications for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations.
