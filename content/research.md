## User Information Artifacts

### User stories

We created user stories to help define project requirements as part of the discovery process for Project Electron. They were generated from user research in the form of in-person interviews, surveys and existing literature. The user stories follow the format:

`“As a [kind of user] I want to do [an action] so that [goal].”`

These user stories are divided into four user groups:

  - Donors and Depositors
  - Researchers
  - Rockefeller Archive Center Staff
  - Allied Information Professionals

[All user stories are available on GitHub](add link).

### Personas

Based on the user stories, we developed thirteen user personas and a persona template. These personas help synthesize our user research, and we engage them in design and development processes as a strategy to center the people who will be using the systems. The personas are divided into three user groups:

  - Donors and Depositors
  - Researchers
  - Information Professionals

  [All personas are available on GitHub](add repo link).

## Data modeling

### Working Data Model

Modeling archival data is essential to building systems integrations and supporting archival discovery. Our model is a work in progress, but we've been building a data model based on the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM). Follow our progress on our [Data Model Wiki](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/rac-data-model/wiki) and check out the working model diagram available on our [Data Model GitHub repository](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/rac-data-model).

### Annotated Bibliography
In the early stages of the project, Project Electron team member Patrick Galligan created an [annotated bibliography on data modeling](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/rac-data-model/blob/master/data_model_bibliography.md), a subject that we had limited previous experience with. This has been a resource for our team, and we hope it can be useful for others in exploring the topic.
