## Project components

### Transfer Specification
A specification for transferring digital records to the RAC over a network connection. This was developed using existing standards and frameworks such as BagIt, BagIt Profiles, Activity Streams, and OAIS.

There are three basic pieces that comprise the transfer specification:

1. [Transfer Requirements](/transfer-requirements/): A document which outlines the major requirements for transfers of digital records, including required metadata, structure, notifications, transfer protocol and size.
2. [RAC BagIt Specification](/rac-bagit-spec/): Requirements for the structure of transfers of digital records, which are based on the BagIt specification. We also included a [BagIt Profile](https://gist.github.com/HaSistrunk/65d59e558c436b9d934d98fd8fb0f575) which encodes these requirements in a machine-readable format to ensure and facilitate compliance.
3. [Example Python scripts](/scripts/) to generate and validate sample bags. These allow users to point to whatever files they want to include in a sample bagâ€™s payload directory.

### Aurora

and their metadata to the archives. Check out the [Aurora user documentation](https://docs.rockarch.org/aurora/) and the code in our [Aurora GitHub repository](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/aurora).
