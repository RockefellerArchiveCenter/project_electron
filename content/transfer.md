We have developed a specification for transferring digital records and their metadata over a network connection. We used existing standards and frameworks such as BagIt, BagIt Profiles, Activity Streams, and OAIS.

There are three basic pieces that comprise the transfer specification:

<div class="container">
  <div class= "twelve columns card">
    <h2>
      <a href="/transfer-requirements/">Transfer Requirements</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Specifies the requirements for transfers of digital records, including required metadata, structure, notifications, transfer protocol and size.</p>
  </div>

  <div class= "twelve columns card">
    <h2>
      <a href="/rac-bagit-spec/">RAC BagIt Specification</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Requirements for the structure of transfers of digital records, which are based on the BagIt specification.</p>
  </div>

  <div class= "twelve columns card">
    <h2>
      <a href="/scripts/">Example scripts and BagIt Profile</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Python scripts to generate and validate sample bags, and an example JSON BagIt Profile which encodes transfer requirements in a machine-readable format to ensure and facilitate compliance.</p>
  </div>
</div>
