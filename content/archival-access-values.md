## Open by default
Start with open access to archival records and description, support the application of consistent, documented, and transparent restrictions.

## Self-directed
Users should be able to adjust the level of mediation necessary for them to use archival records. Interfaces should allow users to self-serve if desired but also ask for expert help when it is needed.

## Respect privacy
Minimize the amount and sensitivity of user data collected (including by and via third parties), and apply sensible data retention policies.

## Generative
Support multiple pathways into and through description and records including people, organization and subjects. Support multiple modes of inquiry including machines, humans and machine-assisted humans. Encourage and reward curiosity.

## Responsive and accessible
Adapt to usersâ€™ needs and their devices.

## Enhance archival processes
Enable reference staff to focus on identifiable core activities. Provide infrastructure to support other RAC initiatives.
