## Working Data Model

Modeling archival data is essential to building systems integrations. It's a work in progress, but we've been building a data model based on PCDM (Portland Common Data Model). Follow our progress on our [Data Model Wiki](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/rac-data-model/wiki) and check out the working model diagram available on our [Data Model GitHub repository](link).

## Annotated Bibliography
In the early stages of the project, Project Electron team member Patrick Galligan created an [annotated bibliography on data modeling](link), a subject that we had limited previous experience with. This has been a resource for our team, and we hope it can be useful for others!
