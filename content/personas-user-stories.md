## User stories

We created user stories to help define project requirements as part of the discovery process for Project Electron. They were generated from user research in the form of in-person interviews, surveys and existing literature. The user stories follow the format:

`“As a [kind of user] I want to do [an action] so that [goal].”`

These user stories are divided into four user groups:

  - Donors and Depositors
  - Researchers
  - Rockefeller Archive Center Staff
  - Allied Information Professionals

[All User stories are available on GitHub](add link).

## Personas

Based on the user stories, we developed thirteen user personas and a persona template. These personas help synthesize our user research, and we engage them in design and development processes as a strategy to center the people who will be using the systems. The personas are divided into three user groups:

  - Donors and Depositors
  - Researchers
  - Information Professionals

  [All personas are available on GitHub](add repo link).
