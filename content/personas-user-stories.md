## User researcher

[the importance of user research for this project and how our approach reinforces a user-centered design process]

### User stories

User stories were gathered for Project Electron through in-person interviews, surveys and exploring existing literature. They follow the format:

“As a [kind of user] I want to do [an action] so that [goal]”.

Thee user stories are divided into four user groups:

  - Donors and Depositors
  - Researchers
  - Rockefeller Archive Center staff
  - Allied Information Professionals

[All User stories are available on GitHub](add link) and released under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal License.

### Personas

From the user stories, thirteen user personas and a persona template were developed for Project Electron. Personas were created for three user groups:

  - Donors and depositors
  - Researchers
  - Information Professionals

  [All personas are available on GitHub](add repo link) and released under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal License.
