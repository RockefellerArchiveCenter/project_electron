# Example Scripts

These scripts use placeholder metadata and ask users to specify a directory (which may contain subdirectories) as the bag payload. Metadata values can be edited by changing variables in each script. A script to validate bags is also available.

These scripts rely on [bagit-python](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python), as well as [bagit-profiles-validator](https://github.com/ruebot/bagit-profiles-validator), which are both Python libraries for creating and validating bags.
