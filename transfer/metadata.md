# Metadata Template

A file named `metadata.json` should be included in the `data/` directory of the bag.

This file must against either [JSON]("http://www.json.org/") or [JSON-LD]("http://json-ld.org/") formats. All of our donors are welcome to add any serialized metadata that they would like to provide the RAC in this file.

The RAC will not index this metadata or include it in our discovery platform, but we will preserve it alongside the records that it pertains to.
