# Metadata Template

A file named `metadata.json` should be included in the `data/` directory of the bag.

The file must be valid [JSON]("http://www.json.org/") or [JSON-LD]("http://json-ld.org/").

The RAC will preserve this file as a bitstream alongside the records that it pertains to, but it may not be indexed as structured data.
