# Rockefeller Archive Center BagIt Specification

Version 1.1.0 (2017-08-14)

This page describes the Rockefeller Archive Center's BagIt specification, developed with the goal of facilitating consistently structured bags - or packages - of digital records which can be programatically validated and verified.

Donor organizations are responsible for creating bags which comply to this specification and transferring them via agreed-upon protocols and schedules. To assist donors in meeting these requirements, a [bag profile for organizational records](organizational-bag-profile.json) as well as [example Python scripts](example-scripts/) to create and validate bags are available in this repository. Other libraries for this specification are available in languages including [Java](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-java), [Python](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python), [PHP](https://github.com/scholarslab/BatItPHP) and [Ruby](https://github.com/topr/bagit).

## Specification
1.  Rockefeller Archive Center bags conform to the [BagIt packaging specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-14 "BagIt Specification")
2.  Rockefeller Archive Center bags may be
    1.  serialized (single ZIP file)
    2.  un-serialized
3.  All bags must valid according to the [Rockefeller Archive Center BagIt profile](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/project_electron/blob/master/transfer/bagit_spec.json "RAC BagIt JSON")

## RAC BagIt Structure
This section includes a simple example of a Rockefeller Archive Center BagIt Specification-compliant bag. Although the Rockefeller Archive Center accepts both serialized and un-serialized bags, this example specifies an unserialized bag.

```
<RAC-BAG-ID>/
    | bagit.txt
    | manifest-md5.txt
    | bag-info.txt
    \--- data/
          | [payload files]
          | metadata.json
```

### Description

###### RAC-BAG-ID
The name of the root directory of the bag. This directory name may include Unicode characters and characters in the extended character set (128â€“255), except for the following reserved characters:

*   `<` (less than)
*   `>` (greater than)
*   `:` (colon)
*   `"` (double quote)
*   `/` (forward slash)
*   `\` (backslash)
*   `|` (vertical bar or pipe)
*   `?` (question mark)
*   `*` (asterisk)
*   `~` (tilde)

###### bagit.txt
As required in the BagIt spec. Includes BagIt version and tag file character encoding.

```
BagIt-Version: 0.97
Tag-File-Character-Encoding: UTF-8
```

###### manifest-md5.txt
This is a required element from the BagIt spec that contains a checksum for every item included in the bag's payload. For this example we have chosen `md5`, but `sha256` is also acceptable.

###### bag-info.txt
The Rockefeller Archive Center requires some of the below fields in our specification, and some are reserved BagIt fields as indicated in the **BagIt Specification**. For more details on the content, requirements, and usage of each field, please see the **Bag-Info Field Specification** section at the bottom of this document. The RAC will index metadata from `bag-info.txt` as structured data. Please use standardized names and avoid the use of all acronyms as separate stakeholders may share the same acronyms but they may mean different things.
