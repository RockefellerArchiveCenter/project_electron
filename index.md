Project Electron aims to build sustainable, user-centered, and standards-compliant infrastructure
to support the ongoing acquisition, management, and preservation of digital records so that we can make
them available in the broadest and most equitable way possible.

## Project components
- Aurora, a web application to support and regularize the ongoing secure transfer of digital records
and their metadata to the archives
- A repository to store digital records and metadata
- Zodiac, an API Gateway to manage system interactions
- A set of microservice applications which support integrations between current and future systems and assist in the archival
processes of accessioning, preservation, description, and access
- An archival discovery system
